#Problem 2
1. int = 5
2. Not Legal: Can't multiply a float by an int
3. Not Legal: The int 1 is not a valid boolean for the if statement
4. Not Legal: The output must either be two strings or two ints because you can't return either an int or a string
5. Not Legal: If this is an independent OCaml program its y value is unbound
6. Not Legal: The expression is fine up until the int 4 which must be a float instead as seen in #7
7. (float -> float) * float = (fun, 4.)
8. int = 7
9. string = "cheezz"
10. Not Legal: The y value doesn't work in the y+x part of the expression because y is trying to combine the string "one" with the int 1 which is invalid
